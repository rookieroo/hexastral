# Publish Checklist — Yuel & Yuun (App Store)

> Every task here is **human / console work** that cannot be done from the repo:
> App Store Connect, RevenueCat dashboard, Apple Developer portal, real secrets,
> screenshots, and the production deploy. The code side is ready (see
> [apps/yuel/status.md](../apps/yuel/status.md), [apps/yuun/launch.md](../apps/yuun/launch.md)).
>
> Canonical IAP mapping: [apps/hexastral-api/src/config/products.ts](../../apps/hexastral-api/src/config/products.ts).
> RevenueCat walkthrough: [docs/setup/revenuecat-entitlements.md](../setup/revenuecat-entitlements.md).
> Brand decision: [ADR-0024](../decisions/0024-app-brand-naming.md).

## 0. App identity (the permanent facts)

| | **Yuel** | **Yuun** |
|---|---|---|
| Directory | `apps/kindred-app` | `apps/auspice-app` |
| Display name (store + device) | Yuel | Yuun |
| Bundle ID (permanent) | `com.hexastral.kindred` | `com.hexastral.auspice` |
| Internal codename (do NOT user-surface) | kindred | auspice |
| Primary category | Lifestyle (2nd: Education) | Reference |
| Brand domain (live) | `yuel.hexastral.com` | `yuun.hexastral.com` |
| Apple Team ID | `L9Z47DW56X` | `L9Z47DW56X` |
| Version / build | 0.1.0 / EAS auto-increment | 0.1.0 / EAS auto-increment |
| **IAP model (MVP)** | Subscription (`kindred_pro`) **+ one-time** (合盘 unlock `hexastral_compatibility`) | **Subscription only** (`auspice_pro`) |

**Yaul** (coin-cast, pre-launch — same worker pattern as Yuel/Yuun):

| | **Yaul** |
|---|---|
| Directory | `apps/coin-cast-app` |
| Display name (store + device) | Yaul |
| Bundle ID (permanent) | `com.hexastral.coincast` |
| Internal codename | coincast |
| Primary category | Reference (2nd: Education) |
| Brand domain (live) | `yaul.hexastral.com` |
| Privacy / Terms | `yaul.hexastral.com/<seg>/privacy/coincast` · `yaul.hexastral.com/<seg>/terms` |
| Associated Domains | `applinks:yaul.hexastral.com` + apex `hexastral.com` (deep links) |

> **Naming policy (ADR-0024 + decided 2026-06):** Yuel/Yuun are the *brand /
> display* layer only. The internal codenames (`kindred`, `auspice`) and the
> RevenueCat entitlement/product IDs stay as-is — the brand is not yet legally
> final (USPTO clearance pending), so do **not** bake `yuel_`/`yuun_` into the
> permanent IAP product IDs. Brand surfaces only in the ASC localized display
> names, which are freely changeable.

---

## 1. Apple Developer portal (both apps)

- [ ] Register App ID for `com.hexastral.kindred` (Yuel)
- [ ] Register App ID for `com.hexastral.auspice` (Yuun)
- [ ] Enable **Sign in with Apple** capability on **both** bundle IDs (apps set `usesAppleSignIn: true`)
- [ ] Add Associated Domains for the applinks each app declares:
  - Yuel: `applinks:yuel.hexastral.com`
  - Yuun: `applinks:hexastral.com`, `applinks:www.hexastral.com`, `applinks:yuun.hexastral.com`
- [ ] Regenerate provisioning profiles **after** enabling the capability above
- [ ] Create a sandbox tester (Users and Access → Sandbox Testers) for IAP testing

---

## 2. App Store Connect — app records

For **each** app (Yuel, then Yuun):

- [ ] Create the app record (bundle ID from §0; Primary Language = English so
      un-localized storefronts fall back to en-US)
- [ ] Set categories per §0
- [ ] Localize the listing for the 4 shipping locales: **en-US, zh-Hans, zh-Hant, ja**
      (copy lives in each app's `aso-metadata.json`)
- [ ] Content rating: 12+
- [ ] **Privacy Policy URL** and **Terms URL** (the binding ASC fields — must resolve):
  - Yuel privacy: `https://yuel.hexastral.com/<seg>/privacy/kindred` · terms: `https://yuel.hexastral.com/<seg>/terms`
    (`<seg>` = `en` | `zh` | `tw` | `ja`)
  - Yuun privacy: `https://yuun.hexastral.com/<seg>/privacy/auspice` · terms: `https://yuun.hexastral.com/<seg>/terms`
    (`<seg>` = `en` | `zh` | `tw` | `ja`) — **RESOLVED 2026-06-25**: Yuun was switched to the
    locale-segmented form so it matches Yuel. `apps/auspice-app/lib/config.ts` now exports
    `privacyUrl(locale)` / `termsUrl(locale)` (were static locale-blind constants), the
    settings screen (`app/(tabs)/me.tsx`) passes the active locale, and the 4
    `aso-metadata.json` descriptions were corrected from the bare `hexastral.com/privacy`
    to `yuun.hexastral.com/<seg>/{privacy/auspice,terms}`. The web route
    `app/[locale]/privacy/[appKey]` exists with `localePrefix: 'as-needed'` (defaultLocale
    `en`) and `appKey=auspice` is registered, so each segmented URL maps to a real page.
    **Still human:** the web routes are code-only until `hexastral-web` is deployed (§5) —
    confirm the URLs return 200 live after that deploy, then paste them into the ASC
    Privacy/Terms fields per App Store locale.
- [ ] Privacy "nutrition" labels:
  - Both apps: **No tracking** (`NSPrivacyTracking: false`), no ATT.
  - Data collected: Apple email (sign-in only), Purchases. Yuel also: user-typed
    birth dates / partner birthdays (typed into the app, not device contacts).
- [ ] Get the **ascAppId** Apple assigns → paste into `eas.json` submit config (see §6)

---

## 3. RevenueCat dashboard

Follow [docs/setup/revenuecat-entitlements.md](../setup/revenuecat-entitlements.md).
**MVP scope (decided 2026-06): ship per-app Pro only.** See §7.

> ✅ **RECONCILED 2026-06-25:** the setup doc previously listed defunct `feng_pro` /
> `hexastral_pro` entitlements and standalone `feng_pro_*` / `hexastral_pro_*` products
> (none of which exist in the live catalog). It has been rewritten to match `products.ts` —
> per-app `kindred_pro` (Yuel) + `auspice_pro` (Yuun); `fate_pro` universe-only;
> `universe_pro` deferred to Phase 2 (§7). `products.ts` is still the source of truth.

### 3.1 Entitlements (create these)
- [ ] `kindred_pro` (Yuel) — display name "Yuel Pro"
- [ ] `auspice_pro` (Yuun) — display name "Yuun Pro"
- [ ] **Do NOT create** `universe_pro` at MVP (see §7)

### 3.2 Products (create in ASC + register in RevenueCat with the *exact* IDs)
| App | Product ID | Type | Grants entitlement | Price (confirm in ASC) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Yuel | `kindred_pro_monthly` | auto-renew sub | `kindred_pro` | $7.99/mo (founder-agreed) |
| Yuel | `kindred_pro_annual` | auto-renew sub | `kindred_pro` | $47.99/yr (founder-agreed) |
| Yuel | `hexastral_compatibility` | consumable | (server-applied, per-bond) | $6.99 |
| Yuun | `auspice_pro_monthly` | auto-renew sub | `auspice_pro` | TBD — confirm |
| Yuun | `auspice_pro_annual` | auto-renew sub | `auspice_pro` | TBD — confirm |

- [ ] Put all subscription products in one Subscription Group (`hexastral_universe`)
- [ ] Attach each product to its entitlement (§3.1)
- [ ] **Offerings**: create `yuan_default` (Yuel: monthly+annual) and `auspice_default`
      (Yuun: monthly+annual). Set each as the app's *current* offering.
  - The Yuel paywall reads only `offerings.current.monthly` / `.annual`; the Yuun
    paywall hardcodes `auspice_pro_*`. Neither surfaces universe — keep it that way.
- [ ] **Webhook**: `https://api.hexastral.com/webhooks/revenuecat`, `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`
      (same value as the Worker's `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`). Events: `INITIAL_PURCHASE`,
      `RENEWAL`, `CANCELLATION`, `EXPIRATION`, `NON_RENEWING_PURCHASE`.
- [ ] Copy the public SDK keys (`appl_*` iOS, `goog_*` Android, `test_*` sandbox) → §6

> The client entitlement IDs are now reconciled to the canonical strings:
> Yuel checks RevenueCat entitlement `kindred_pro` (was `hexastral_kindred_pro` —
> fixed). So the RevenueCat entitlement **Identifier must be exactly `kindred_pro`**.

---

## 4. Secrets — Cloudflare Worker (hexastral-api)

- [ ] `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — must equal the RevenueCat webhook Bearer token
      (`cd apps/hexastral-api && wrangler secret put REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
- [ ] Any Yuun calendar/push secret required by `apps/yuun/launch.md` (e.g. the
      calendar signing secret) — confirm against that doc before deploy

---

## 5. Backend deploy + DB migration

> **About "migration 0012":** migrations are **sequential and cumulative** — you
> cannot (and don't need to) apply `0012` alone. `bun db:migrate:prod` runs
> `wrangler d1 migrations apply hexastral-db --remote`, which applies *every*
> unapplied migration in order (currently up to `0018`). 0012 (`timeline_readings`,
> the timeline deep-read) is just one of the pending set; running the command once
> catches prod up through 0018. "0012 not migrated" simply means prod is behind —
> the single command fixes it.

Order (local wrangler — CI does NOT deploy):
- [ ] Internal services first: `svc-astro`, `svc-notify`, `svc-signal`, `svc-geocode`,
      `svc-mailer`, `svc-admin-notify`, `svc-tail` (each: `cd services/<svc> && bun deploy`)
- [ ] API + migrations:
      ```bash
      cd apps/hexastral-api
      bun db:migrate:prod      # applies all pending migrations (…→0018) to remote D1
      bun deploy
      ```
- [ ] Web (serves the privacy/terms + invite landings on all three domains):
      `cd apps/hexastral-web && bun deploy`
- [ ] Verify `https://api.hexastral.com/webhooks/revenuecat` is reachable

---

## 6. eas.json secrets (both apps — currently `REPLACE_WITH_*` placeholders)

For `apps/kindred-app/eas.json` **and** `apps/auspice-app/eas.json`:
- [ ] `EXPO_PUBLIC_EAS_PROJECT_ID` (run `eas init` per app)
- [ ] `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_KEY` (`appl_*`; `test_*` for sandbox builds)
- [ ] `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_ANDROID_KEY` (`goog_*`, only if shipping Android)
- [ ] `submit.production.ios.ascAppId` (from §2; `appleTeamId` is already `L9Z47DW56X`)

> The app no-ops RevenueCat while the key still looks like `REPLACE_WITH_*`, so
> builds won't crash — but IAP is dead until real keys are in.

---

## 7. MVP scope decisions (do NOT ship these at launch)

- **Universe Pro** (`universe_pro`, the cross-app bundle): plumbing exists in code,
  but **do not create the `universe_pro_*` products or a `universe_default` offering**
  at MVP. Reason: cross-app value is ~nil with only 2 apps live, it complicates
  pricing and enlarges the review surface. Add it as a Phase-2 upsell once 3+ apps
  ship. No code change needed — the paywalls already can't surface it.
- **Cross-app memory** (`crossAppMemoryEnabled`): opt-in, default false, gated to
  the universe tier — so with no universe sold, it is already off. The Yuel settings
  toggle that surfaced it has been **removed from the app** (server flag stays
  default-false; `lib/memory-preference.ts` kept dormant for post-MVP restore). Keep
  "links data across apps" **off** the privacy labels even though terms/privacy text
  mentions the capability. Same-app portfolio memory (Pro) is fine to keep.
- **Yuel solo personal report** (`hexastral_personal`, $4.99): client button is
  null-guarded and won't render until the product exists in ASC. Optional post-launch.

---

## 8. Screenshots & final preflight

- [ ] Screenshots: 6.7" iPhone, 5–6 per locale × 4 locales, per
      [docs/publish/screenshot-direction.md](./screenshot-direction.md) (two-chart compare /
      invite / AI chat for Yuel; almanac / timeline for Yuun — avoid zodiac/fortune visuals)
- [ ] Reviewer notes + a demo account (template in [launch-checklist.md](../launch-checklist.md))
- [~] `bun typecheck && bun lint && bun test` (2026-06-25): **typecheck clean** (36/36;
      fixed a pre-existing type error in `packages/scenario-kindred/src/components/ChapterPager.tsx`
      — the `widths` array needed `as const` for RN's `DimensionValue`), **test clean**
      (993 pass / 0 fail). **lint is NOT clean** — pre-existing format drift, see §9.
- [x] aso-metadata char-count — script added at `scripts/aso-charcount.mjs`; run
      `node scripts/aso-charcount.mjs apps/auspice-app/aso-metadata.json apps/kindred-app/aso-metadata.json`.
      Both apps verified within limits 2026-06-25 (Yuun en-US description 2228/4000 after the URL edit).
- [ ] Build + submit:
      ```bash
      cd apps/kindred-app   # then apps/auspice-app
      eas build --profile production --platform ios
      eas submit --platform ios
      ```

Submission order (ADR-0019): ship the lower-risk Reference app (Yuun) first to
build publisher credibility, then Yuel.

## 9. Known issues to resolve before/at submission

- [x] **Yuun privacy/terms URL** — RESOLVED 2026-06-25 (see §2). Switched Yuun to the
      locale-segmented form like Yuel: `lib/config.ts` now exports `privacyUrl(locale)` /
      `termsUrl(locale)`, `me.tsx` passes the locale, and the 4 `aso-metadata.json`
      descriptions were corrected to `yuun.hexastral.com/<seg>/...`. Live 200-check still
      pending the `hexastral-web` deploy (§5).
- [x] **revenuecat-entitlements.md was stale** — RESOLVED 2026-06-25: rewritten to match
      `products.ts` (`kindred_pro`/`auspice_pro`; `fate_pro` universe-only; `universe_pro`
      Phase 2). See §3.
- [ ] **`bun lint` is red on `main` (pre-existing format drift)** — found 2026-06-25:
      ~21 Biome errors across 7 workspaces (astro-core, auspice-app, hexastral-api,
      hexastral-web, kindred-app, scenario-kindred, scenario-yuan), almost all `format`
      category + one `organizeImports`. **Not introduced by the URL/doc work** — those
      files pass Biome. Fix is mechanical and safe: `bun lint:fix` (≈400 lines across ~22
      files); kept out of this pass so it doesn't muddy the launch diff. Run it as a
      dedicated formatting commit, confirm `bun lint` green, then re-run `bun typecheck && bun test`.
- [ ] **CJK font** (`NotoSerifSC`) not bundled in Yuel (offline blocker) — ships on
      system serif; revisit post-launch for polish.
- [x] **Yuun orphan one-time-purchase scaffolding** — `apps/auspice-app/lib/synastry-iap.ts`
      (unused `hexastral_compatibility` one-time purchase) **deleted** so Yuun's code matches
      its subscription-only MVP. Restore from git when the synastry-in-auspice PLAN is built.
- [x] **Dead duplicate route** — `bonds.ts` had `POST /:id/unlock` registered twice; the
      second (legacy coins / `unlockedDimensions` model) was shadowed by the live
      `single_purchase` handler and **deleted**. (Project-wide scan: the only other duplicate,
      `signal.ts` `.get('/')`, is two distinct routers — not dead.)
